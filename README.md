The file covers different health diseases and diagnosis numbers as well as death rates. I used this data to create a Machine Learning Model to estimate rates per 100,000 based on other features. 
The data i used was Yearstart which is the beginning of the data collection period, datavalue which is the incident rate per 100,000 people, locationdesc which is the state or territory, stratification1 which is demographic, and question which is the type of cancer being measured. The data was filtered to only include cancer and rates per 100,000 people.Missing values in location, stratification, and question were filled with "Unknown" or "Overall". Overall means it applies to the entire demographic. I chose random forest because it handles nonlinear relationships and provided the best r^2 with the given data. I used 200 estimators, and a 20% test size. log1p was used to smooth large variance. Some values were encoded using dummies. The r^2 was .9675 and MSE was .0735 which are both great to indicate the model can explain 96.75% of the data. Adding the question feature made the biggest difference in the R^2 because it added a specific way of categorizing the cancer
